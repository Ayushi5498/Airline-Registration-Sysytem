✈️ Airline Registration System
A C++ based console application for booking flights, selecting travel dates, generating tickets, and managing user details. Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this system simulates a basic airline ticket booking platform.

📅 Project Timeline
Development Period: February – March 2025

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
Language: C++

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Version Control: Git

🧩 Key Features
🛫 Flight Booking System
Book flights to user-selected destinations

Intuitive interface to display real-time flight availability

Users can customize travel options including:

Destination

Date and time of travel

Number of tickets

🧾 Ticket Generation
Users receive a system-generated ticket after completing the booking process

Tickets include:

Passenger information

Flight details

Travel date and time

👥 User Authentication
Basic user login and registration system

Prevents unauthorized access and maintains user-specific data

🔐 Error Handling & Data Validation
Handles invalid inputs gracefully

Ensures only valid dates, destination codes, and user data are accepted

💾 Persistent Data Storage
Stores booking information for future reference using file handling in C++

Ticket and user data persist between sessions

🚀 Optimized for Performance
Designed to handle multiple booking operations simultaneously

Clean and modular OOP design improves scalability and maintenance# Airline-Registration-Sysytem
💡 Future Enhancements
Add graphical user interface (GUI) using Qt or other frameworks

Integrate payment gateway simulation

Implement admin panel for flight management
